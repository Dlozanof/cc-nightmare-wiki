<p>Future dystopia in which Corporate wants to get resource from across the galaxy. This is you, an executive junior manager, doing a reverse-funded internship for VA Incorporated TM:</p>

<img src="/intro_img.png"  alt="Hello Friend"  class="center"  style="border-radius: 8px;"    />


<p>As many others, you are in charge of extracting all resources of interest from your assigned planet. To do so you will define rewards for tasks that can be accomplished, and the people corporate will migrate there will work on them. These rewards are the only way they can keep living there! These so-called Corporate Citizens are born under contract, and their lifespan is directly associated to their productivity.</p>
<p>Corporate knows this is a daunting task, and provides &ldquo;Drunkyards TM&rdquo; and &ldquo;Weaponize.ME TM&rdquo; buildings within your base. These are the main ways of getting  entertainment and equipment for the CC living in the planet, so they will be able to grow and be more profitable!</p>
<p>This is great news, since if you do not reach the objectives you will be terminated as per clause V.12.3 section 3 paragraph 2:</p>

<p>Every day you will define rewards for different available missions, and the CC living in your base will take upon them depending on the reward/risk ratio. Risk depends on the individual/group of CC which will partake on the mission, as it is relative to their abilities and equipment.</p>
<p>On the beginning most missions will be of scouting the planet, trying to find the areas with the most profitable resources, of any kind.</p>

    Did you know? Average Managers are said to enjoy a lot the innards of certain xenofrogs which only live in sector Alpha-32. It was a junior just like you who found this and lived a prosperous life! Not only she lived to the old age of 34, she even got a yearly vacation day off!).
  </div>
</div>

<p>We all know we are not alone in the galaxy, but we are much less alone in this planet. There is flora and fauna which does not like to be plundered, so scouting and harvesting are not the only things to do during a mission. Our CC are trained in combat and will face these dangers to the best of their ability. This does not mean success in 100% (nor 20%) of cases, but do not falter. Others will come to take their place soon!</p>

<p>Specifically, a mission will have a reward (defined by you) and certain risk factors (flora/fauna, weather, environment) which are palliated by expertise and equipment of CC. This ratio is then compared with the necessities of the CC and if the outcome is good enough, the CC will take on the mission.</p>
<p>When he does, you will get a notification and will receive a report once it is finished (one way or another). This include what happened in every stage and the resources/objectives that were achieved. Finally if the mission is successful a certain amount of credits will be deducted from your loan.</p>
<p>These resources are your lifeblood, are directly sent to Corporate HQ for further processing and a certain amount of credits will be added to your balance. You can use them to pay off your loan or to invest them into improving your base. This mostly means better equipment for your CC.</p>

    Random idea: In the map view you can construct mining bases which provide certain inflow of resources daily. They can be assaulted by fauna so missions to clear them up can be created. Maybe long term missions with daily cost to operate them?? -&gt; Not a lot of sense since this is pretty much a long `gather` mission. But possible.

<h2 id="clause-v1132---market">Clause V.11.3.2 - Market<a href="#clause-v1132---market" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>There is a dynamic market in which prices fluctuate every week. It does not make sense to gather adamantite when the market is overflown with it, but lacking &ldquo;wood&rdquo;. Or maybe you can just not sell the resources and wait for a better moment. As long as you have the funds to do this, of course.</p>
<p>So, the market indicates the best resource to get for maximum profit. Then in the mission tab you can filter available missions by resources that can be obtained and focus on them.</p>

<p>Some aspects generals to all missions is that they all can be successful or a failure. If it fails it means the risk was too high for the CC to take on, and he tried to go back to base. A small mishap might mean a horde of xenos ganking up on the CC so this is not always possible and he will be decommissioned as a result.</p>
<p>In this case the reward is not provided of course, but fret not, CC got the best rewards of all: experience! Learning from past mistakes is a valuable asset, is it not? And we are talking about literal experience points, avoidance/scout related skill will be improved so the survival rate of future missions will be even higher.</p>
<p>On mission success experience is also granted, but related to the mission at hand. In <code>gather</code> missions the gathering-related skills are the ones that are improved.</p>

      <figcaption class="right"  style="color: red;" >Here you can see details of all available missions</figcaption>

<p>Unless otherwise stated, a mission consists on several phases.</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel to POI</li>
<li>Execute mission</li>
<li>Return from POI</li>
</ul>
<p>During each of these phases some events can happen, and are reported independently of the other phases. After the mission is finished a report is generated with the following structure</p>
<p><strong>Mission name</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Travel to POI
<ul>
<li>Day 1 - Uneventful</li>
<li>Day 2 - Xeno ambush
<ul>
<li>Combat report</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Day 3 - Uneventful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Execute mission
<ul>
<li>Day 4 - Uneventful</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return from POI
<ul>
<li>Day 5 - Uneventful</li>
<li>Day 6 - Uneventful</li>
<li>Day 7 - Crew fight ???</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see some missions can take a long time, so plan ahead objective-wise. If you depend on the success of several long-term missions and some of them fail you are in for trouble!</p>

<h3 id="clause-v11331---scout">Clause V.11.3.3.1 - Scout<a href="#clause-v11331---scout" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>There are many kind of missions. But to access them you need to know about your environment (how do you plan to gather minerals without locating them first?). Scout missions increase the <code>Scouted</code> percentage of a sector. If it reaches 100% it means it has been completely explored and there is nothing else to find there.</p>
<p>Increasing the <code>Scouted</code> percentage unblocks missions in the sector. It means your scouts found points of interests within, and then you can assign missions related to them. For example if a mineral vein is found a <code>Gather</code> mission can be created.</p>
<p>Corporate is not blind however, and has a basic idea of what is on the planet (they would never send you to explore a random planet, after all. You cost money. Almost.) This means that you know the biome and geography of the different sectors, so you know what to expect. I just expect you do not try to find minerals in the sea. (wtf, this is probably valid). Specifically for every sector you know beforehand which resources you can expect to find.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sector S4 [Scouted 30%]
Risk rating: LOW/MED/HIGH
Can find: Rocks, Wood, Ore, Domgles, Hoferters
Available: Wood [LW/MD/RICH]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result of a scouting mission can be a success or a failure (escape / death of scout) depending on the ratio between the risk rating and the scout&rsquo;s abilities. A successful mission might yield the location of new POIs which in turn yield more kind of missions; it will always (even in failure????) increase the <code>scouted %</code> so future missions have higher probability of yielding POIs.</p>
<h3 id="clause-v11332---gather">Clause V.11.3.3.2 - Gather<a href="#clause-v11332---gather" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Sector S5
Risk rating: LOW/MED/HIGH
Gather resource: <code>&lt;</code> Wood <code>&gt;</code>   &laquo;&lt; <code>&lt;/&gt;</code> allows to select the desired resource????</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This one I am not so clear how to define how many resources should yield. I think it should increase with <code>gatherer</code> skill.</p>
<p><strong>Idea 1</strong>
Divide the <code>execution day</code> into hours, and every hour should have a % of combat, diminishing the gathering of that hour. This is not great since could completely break a long expedition in the first hour if combat is lost.</p>
<p><strong>Idea 2</strong>
<code>pest control</code> mission purpose is pretty much to clear enemies in this POI so the risk rating goes down, increasing yield of <code>gather</code> mission. A very simplified formula would be
$$ yield = CC_{number}\cdot 1/enemise \cdot gather_{skill} \cdot 10   $$
Risk rating does not automatically involve actual combat, but represents the bothersome presence of hostiles in the area. CCs have to do evasive maneuvers and hide from them to keep working in peace.</p>
<p>Of course, combat is still possible. It affects gathering yield by removing some amount of the yield. On the other hand, combat skills are improved and xeno materials are &ldquo;gathered&rdquo;.</p>
<p>CCs that specialize in gathering can acquire equipment that improves their skills, helps avoiding enemies or other kind of benefits. All this in the end results in increased yield. For the same reward! CCs are nothing if not proud of a joob well done.</p>

<p>This one is quite simple. Most POIs (if not all) have some kind of hostiles lurking around and making difficult (if not impossible) to work there. Some CC teams/individuals specialize in clearing these areas so other teams can <code>gather</code> in peace at a later time.</p>
<p>At least one combat round is guaranteed, but if there are more hostiles in the area more combat rounds can happen. Depends on how the CCs feel.</p>

<p>This one and <code>terminate</code> are sort of related. Could also be related to the hostiles modeling in the world.

    Random idea: I am currently thinking of, which could connect many dots, is that you can locate nests of hostiles or alpha ones which can be `terminated`.

<p><code>pest control</code> is done to remove average hostiles. <code>Terminate</code> is to really remove the source of them, and the risk level is completely off the charts (and so CC&rsquo;s expect the rewards to be).</p>
<p>Think of them as Bosses. The effect of clearing them out should be different than just a big <code>pest control</code> mission. There can be some smaller ones that are blocking our access to some resources, and big ones that would remove the threat level in the sectors the <code>clan</code> control.</p>
